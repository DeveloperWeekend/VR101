# Types of VR

Broadly, VR can be classified based on its type of immersion and the type of device you intend to use. 

Based on Type of Immersion, VR can be categorized broadly as :   
1. 360 Degree Media and  
2. Computer Generated 3D VR \(CG3D VR\)

#### 360 Degree Media

These are basically 360 Degree Camera-shot images or videos or rendered scenes or images in 3D.

Camera shot 360 media enable you to experience or see a real-life place or scenario shot using a 360 degree camera.

#### Mobile VR

In 2011, when all the buzz about VR started coming in since the Oculus was announced, there was a general stigma that only people with high-end PCs can experince VR. 

But all that changed when Google came out with the Google Cardboard and showed everyone that you already have a VR capable device in your own hands - your Smartphone.  
Mobile phones, even though it may not be able to give you the quality of immersion the PC VR headsets can give you.
