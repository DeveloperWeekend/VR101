* add image

You can look around in the environment, the environment is a farm - like , low-polygon 3D space.   
  
You can also check out the scene in the "**Game View**" by clicking the play button and you can look around the scene by " _Moving the mouse pointer while holding the '**Alt'** key_ ".   
This is how you would be viewing the scene in VR. 

You might have noticed that the scene in incomplete.  
**Your task is to finish the scene by completing the following tasks .**  
There are 5 tasks to be completed :

* [ ] **3. Adjust the directional light**
* [ ] **4. Change the name of the farm**
* [ ] **5. Add an ambient audio**
* [ ] **6. Take a screen video while in "play mode" and submit it.**

#### 1. Rounding up the sheep and the horses.

Within the scene you will find that all the sheep are scattered throughout the environment. You have to move all the sheep using the "_Translate tool and rotate tool_ " , into the fence shown below.

**Bonus points**  
You may customise the scene even more by adding more trees, animals and other elements which you can find within the "**Art**" folder in the Assets window.  
To add them to the scene all you have to do is drag prefab into the scene.  
  
- you may try this after all the other tasks have been completed.
{% endhint %}

**3. Adjust the light**

You can adjust the lighting in the scene by changing the direction of the "Directional Light"  in the hierarchy window.

**4. Change the Name of the Farm**

This farm practically belongs to you now, since you have done all this work in rounding up the animals and customising it. so it is obvious that this Farm should be named after you. You will see the Farm is named "VR101 Farm" right now on the signboard.  
  
You can change the Farm's name on the signboard by selecting the text and changing it to "\*your name\*".

* add image here

For Example if you name is "Raj", then you have to change the name to " Raj's Farm " or any crazy name you can think of.

**5. Add Audio**

Now that is done, you need to make it feel like it is a farm. In order to do that you need to add a background audio.   
You will find an audio clip in the "Audio" folder in the Assets window.  
You will also find an "Audio Source" in the hierarchy window aswell. Select the Audio Source and add the audio clip to the audio source by dragging it to the inspector window to the "Audio Clip" place holder.

* add image here

You can test your scene at any point by turning on the "Play Mode". Make sure that whatever you add to the scene should be visible in the Play mode when you look around the scene by moving the mouse while pressing the "Alt" key.



**6. Take a screen video while in "play mode".**

To submit your application, you need to take a screen video of the scene, while in Play mode while slowly rotating the view in the game view. Make sure all the elements you would want to show is perfectly captured in the screen video.

* add image or video here
* need to add links to how to take a screen video record.
